Uses too much battery. Not as cost effective as I expected it to be. Not recommended,"

  It uses 3 AA cells, the first day light intensity was good, but two days later the lights got dim. Meaning if you are planning on keeping it on for a longer duration at stretch, then it becomes more expensive because you will have to use 3 AA cells every other day.Better to go for usb led lights or direct electric light.I do not recommend this product.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

  I am writing this review after 2 weeks of usage. Actually my daughter is using this laptop for studying purpose.First of all, I would like to thank Amazon for delivering the laptop in good condition and in on time. Thank you so much.

Few points I would like to high light  over here1. The laptop is very handy and light weight.2.  Boots up and shut down is so fast.. amazing.3. 256 GB ssd adding great value to the speed4. Display is amazing.5. Finger print , keyboard backlit ,  webcam shutter is a very good featuresIf you have double minded to buy this laptop, don't think about it, Please go ahead. Nice laptop.

  Overall the laptop is quite good, but the battery backup is not up to the marks, and the fast charge is also not effective. Display quality is good, camera and privacy options are also good.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

Happy Customer,"

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

  It is a good budget laptop. You wont get the said configuration in Dell or other brands. So far the laptop is working fine.  Decent metal built. However, the display is just ok. Not that good when compared to Dell but workable. Overall a decent laptop.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  For a 15 Inch laptop it is light weight. I have a combo of 256GB (SSD) + 1 TB.I occasionally play CS:Go. Though I would not recommend it for gaming as it gets heated during gaming.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Display is amazing.5. Finger print , keyboard backlit ,  webcam shutter is a very good featuresIf you have double minded to buy this laptop, don't think about it, Please go ahead. Nice laptop.

  Overall the laptop is quite good, but the battery backup is not up to the marks, and the fast charge is also not effective. Display quality is good, camera and privacy options are also good.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

Happy Customer,"

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

In two months of use, the Laptop screen has got detached (in part) from the screen frame and the laptop needs to be used as a desktop till it is repaired. The Lenovo service centre requires to keep the Laptop for at leat 2 weeks to replace the laptop screen frame.  Since Lenovo was aware of this defect they should have recalled the unsold stock with their Customers and rectified the defect.

The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

  It is a good budget laptop. You wont get the said configuration in Dell or other brands. So far the laptop is working fine.  Decent metal built. However, the display is just ok. Not that good when compared to Dell but workable. Overall a decent laptop.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

A very good configuration at a reasonable price,"

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery.

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Perfect laptop for programmers but 8GB RAM is very less,"

  This laptop is amazing but would have been the best if it was with 16GB RAM. I bought it for INR 66499.Design: 5/5Keyboard: 5/5Trackpad: 4/5 (best in windows laptop)Camera: 4/5Sound: 4.5/5 (for normal use it is really good, but for the music lover, it may not be that good)Overall performance: 4/5Booting Speed: 5/5 (faster than Macbook even, I have both)RAM: 3/5 (it should be 16GB)8GB RAM is very low for windows 10, 5-6 tabs of chrome occupy 1GB of RAM. I read that it can be extended to 12/16 GB but not sure. Will try to extend it after some time. but now have to operate with very few applications at a time.2 VSCode and 5 Chrome occupies 6.9GB RAM of 7.9GB.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

Worst Experience!!,"

  I’ve been a Amazon loyalist since 2014. I totally trusted their QUALITY Assurance! I bought this laptop 2 months back. The display cover  started opening up from the left side. I just realised after reading the reviews at a lot of customers have had the same problem. I had a lot of plans to buys some electronics in the great Indian Sale but didn’t have the confidence now.Whom do I contact  to get this fixed ????

  The laptop even though it's a 15.6 screen, the laptop appears to be like a notebook as they reduced the frame size width which is easy to handle.. I ordered for silver one as shown in image but as it was delivers it was dark grey in color. But I liked it and didn't think of a return. The one negative feedback is as I ordered for a silver  color body laptop as in image but the one delivered was dark grey in color for the body.

Display started behaving abnormally after 1 year of use,"

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

This is very useful for student and professional for coding use.....gamers stay away.....u can play games in it  but it's not built for gaming purpose nd may face issues later...

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it..

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Perfect laptop for programmers but 8GB RAM is very less,"

  This laptop is amazing but would have been the best if it was with 16GB RAM. I bought it for INR 66499.Design: 5/5Keyboard: 5/5Trackpad: 4/5 (best in windows laptop)Camera: 4/5Sound: 4.5/5 (for normal use it is really good, but for the music lover, it may not be that good)Overall performance: 4/5Booting Speed: 5/5 (faster than Macbook even, I have both)RAM: 3/5 (it should be 16GB)8GB RAM is very low for windows 10, 5-6 tabs of chrome occupy 1GB of RAM. I read that it can be extended to 12/16 GB but not sure. Will try to extend it after some time. but now have to operate with very few applications at a time.2 VSCode and 5 Chrome occupies 6.9GB RAM of 7.9GB.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

Worst Experience!!,"

  I’ve been a Amazon loyalist since 2014. I totally trusted their QUALITY Assurance! I bought this laptop 2 months back. The display cover  started opening up from the left side. I just realised after reading the reviews at a lot of customers have had the same problem. I had a lot of plans to buys some electronics in the great Indian Sale but didn’t have the confidence now.Whom do I contact  to get this fixed ????

  The laptop even though it's a 15.6 screen, the laptop appears to be like a notebook as they reduced the frame size width which is easy to handle.. I ordered for silver one as shown in image but as it was delivers it was dark grey in color. But I liked it and didn't think of a return. The one negative feedback is as I ordered for a silver  color body laptop as in image but the one delivered was dark grey in color for the body.

  Been using it for around a month now. It is light, compact and has good battery life (approx 11 hours) . Latches on to Wifi well, sound quality and camera is also good. Pretty satisfied with the product. Be aware that it has Windows10 home version and not Pro, so you cannot use Remote Desktop option.

Display started behaving abnormally after 1 year of use,"

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out.

A very good configuration at a reasonable price,"

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.  So please avoid Lenovo if you want to purchase with their 'Back2School' offerSo pl

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

  if you purchase from Lenevo official website, get a more discount compare to Amazon with cash back offer. Over all good product but not so light. Battery backup not satisfactory.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Perfect laptop for programmers but 8GB RAM is very less,"

  This laptop is amazing but would have been the best if it was with 16GB RAM. I bought it for INR 66499.Design: 5/5Keyboard: 5/5Trackpad: 4/5 (best in windows laptop)Camera: 4/5Sound: 4.5/5 (for normal use it is really good, but for the music lover, it may not be that good)Overall performance: 4/5Booting Speed: 5/5 (faster than Macbook even, I have both)RAM: 3/5 (it should be 16GB)8GB RAM is very low for windows 10, 5-6 tabs of chrome occupy 1GB of RAM. I read that it can be extended to 12/16 GB but not sure. Will try to extend it after some time. but now have to operate with very few applications at a time.2 VSCode and 5 Chrome occupies 6.9GB RAM of 7.9GB.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  I’ve been a Amazon loyalist since 2014. I totally trusted their QUALITY Assurance! I bought this laptop 2 months back. The display cover  started opening up from the left side. I just realised after reading the reviews at a lot of customers have had the same problem. I had a lot of plans to buys some electronics in the great Indian Sale but didn’t have the confidence now.Whom do I contact  to get this fixed ????

  The laptop even though it's a 15.6 screen, the laptop appears to be like a notebook as they reduced the frame size width which is easy to handle.. I ordered for silver one as shown in image but as it was delivers it was dark grey in color. But I liked it and didn't think of a return. The one negative feedback is as I ordered for a silver  color body laptop as in image but the one delivered was dark grey in color for the body.

Pretty satisfied with the product. Be aware that it has Windows10 home version and not Pro, so you cannot use Remote Desktop option.

Display started behaving abnormally after 1 year of use,"

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out.

A very good configuration at a reasonable price,"

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.  So please avoid Lenovo if you want to purchase with their 'Back2School' offerSo pl

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  Good1. Battery life is extremely good2. Very thin3. Track pad is goodBad1. Laptop started freezing and it's not even 4 months old2. Terrible Lenovo service. It's been a month struggling with support people and still they didn't fix my freeze issue and it had gotten worse.  Service engineer guy tried to fix it and made it even worse,  now the track pad is also not working.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  Been using it for around a month now. It is light, compact and has good battery life (approx 11 hours) . Latches on to Wifi well, sound quality and camera is also good. Pretty satisfied with the product. Be aware that it has Windows10 home version and not Pro, so you cannot use Remote Desktop option.

Display started behaving abnormally after 1 year of use,"

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

This is very useful for student and professional for coding use.....gamers stay away.....u can play games in it  but it's not built for gaming purpose nd may face issues later...

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

Poor build quality,"

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

Fake offer - BackToSchool (Benefits of 16990 at 1399),"

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.  So please avoid Lenovo if you want to purchase with their 'Back2School' offerSo pl

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

Please do not buy this product. A humble request,"

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

  Lenovo product never fails in delivering a quality.Pros:Rick look and feelStunning display and performance— I use multi desktop display and normally use for programming(huge workloads)/MS office/movies but no gaming.Super quick startup/shutdown — I had an HP laptop which was super slowFingerprint works like charmLight weight and does not heat up— you can keep it on Lap for longer duration.Battery lasts pretty long— I don’t shut it down and hardly charge it full twice in a week. Battery is not consumed in standby mode so far.Free Antivirus, MS office surely helpsI loved the lenovo app which helps install essential softwares and upgrades.Cons:Camera quality is poor— But I hardly use it..Thanks Amazon for supper quick and safe delivery within 2 days even during pandemic!!

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  I spend almost 8hrs a day on my Laptop. This laptop seems to be a little pricy, but at this price, the configuration is a good combination. The laptop looks sleek and compact. The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

  Product is good. I purchased this laptop since Lenovo gave BackToSchool offer .But its 100% fake; they have impossible hidden rules to avail this offer. They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

  Best laptop from lenovo in the budget of 60-70kNote i got this at 61k from lenovo offline showroom....so i would suggest you to buy it offline as here you are paying 10k extra plus you have to wait also....I heard about the screen flickering issue from reviews but i have not faced any screen flickering issue till using it for 5 months now.....For specification you can read other reviews.... This is very useful for student and professional for coding use.....gamers stay away.....u can play games in it  but it's not built for gaming purpose nd may face issues later...

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Purchased the Laptop two months back. This product has a manufacturing defect which is known to Lenovo. In two months of use, the Laptop screen has got detached (in part) from the screen frame and the laptop needs to be used as a desktop till it is repaired. The Lenovo service centre requires to keep the Laptop for at leat 2 weeks to replace the laptop screen frame.  Since Lenovo was aware of this defect they should have recalled the unsold stock with their Customers and rectified the defect.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

Avoid purchase of this product!!,"

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

a great option if you are looking for a powerful and cute machine in a budget,"

  even though i didn""t purchase this product from amazon im reviwing this because im in love with this laptop.the laptop looks cute and sleek from all the angles you are looking at it.the overall built quality is just great as it gets a full aluminium body.i bought it for rs 66.4k and im really satisfied with my decision.it boots up in less than 8 second.thanks to its 256GB SSD. the performance is just great.it gets a backlit keyboardt.so using this cute baby at dark conditions wont be a great deal.it also gets  NVIDIA MX250 graphic card,so small gaming and editing can be done with ease.the battery performace is also impressive. i was able to get almost 5-8hours with a single charge with 15+ % remaining.the laptop looks slim ans light in weight.the ports in this laptop is adequate for a normal user.so in overall performance and fore the looks of this machine i would rate it 9.5/10.so if you are looking for a laptop under 66k this will be the suggestion from my side.comment and let me know if you find this review helpful

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

  Based on one day setup & usage experience:The Laptop has the same configuration as described. SSD makes it boot super fast. No issue in activating provided OEM software. Fingr print reader works like charm. One more very useful thing is the inbuilt Webcam cover, its a really thoughtful feature. Wonderful machine, although I fell its little pricy at 66K+. Keyboard may take a little getting used to.One warning: It mentioned 1 year Lenovo warranty, however I only see 9 months of warranty left (not sure how 3 months are lost with the seller?).

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover.

Display started behaving abnormally after 1 year of use,"

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

Lenovo never fails to deliver!,"

  Lenovo product never fails in delivering a quality.Pros:Rick look and feelStunning display and performance— I use multi desktop display and normally use for programming(huge workloads)/MS office/movies but no gaming.Super quick startup/shutdown — I had an HP laptop which was super slowFingerprint works like charmLight weight and does not heat up— you can keep it on Lap for longer duration.Battery lasts pretty long— I don’t shut it down and hardly charge it full twice in a week. Battery is not consumed in standby mode so far.Free Antivirus, MS office surely helpsI loved the lenovo app which helps install essential softwares and upgrades.Cons:Camera quality is poor— But I hardly use it..Thanks Amazon for supper quick and safe delivery within 2 days even during pandemic!!

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

  1. Do not buy this product as Lenovo is Chinese Company.2. Pathetic Service, When you try to reach Customer Care and if no one responds within 6 minutes than your call gets disconnected.3. Battery Life is Okay, not that good. If you play EA Sports 07, battery will last ariund 2hrs 20mins.4. Heats alot even in normal work.5. Good Speed, HDD and SSD both.6. Design, keyboard and touchpad is nice.7. Sound is also good, not best but good.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

Avoid purchase of this product!!,"

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

  Based on one day setup & usage experience:The Laptop has the same configuration as described. SSD makes it boot super fast. No issue in activating provided OEM software. Fingr print reader works like charm. One more very useful thing is the inbuilt Webcam cover, its a really thoughtful feature. Wonderful machine, although I fell its little pricy at 66K+. Keyboard may take a little getting used to.One warning: It mentioned 1 year Lenovo warranty, however I only see 9 months of warranty left (not sure how 3 months are lost with the seller?).

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

Lenovo never fails to deliver!,"

  Lenovo product never fails in delivering a quality.Pros:Rick look and feelStunning display and performance— I use multi desktop display and normally use for programming(huge workloads)/MS office/movies but no gaming.Super quick startup/shutdown — I had an HP laptop which was super slowFingerprint works like charmLight weight and does not heat up— you can keep it on Lap for longer duration.Battery lasts pretty long— I don’t shut it down and hardly charge it full twice in a week. Battery is not consumed in standby mode so far.Free Antivirus, MS office surely helpsI loved the lenovo app which helps install essential softwares and upgrades.Cons:Camera quality is poor— But I hardly use it..Thanks Amazon for supper quick and safe delivery within 2 days even during pandemic!!

"good laptop, but the screen is not up to the mark","

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

The screen resolution is high and the text is pretty crisp.After almost 7 days, the laptop doesn't heat up, the performance seems to be on the peak with the 10th generation processor. Corei5 has many plus points than the corei3, however, the difference is not that much noticeable between i5 and i7.Overall this laptop is faster, lightweight and doesn't heat up on your lap.The downside is that the ethernet port is missing.The USB 3.2 is a plus point, but I really can't use USB 3.2 for my old storage disks.Overall the laptop is great for all-day work with loads of graphics processing.

They will move your order ticket to On-Hold easily.Rule No 1: In my case, I purchased Laptop to deliver at my work location. But your Government ID should have the same delivery address in Permanent Address Field. I cleared in call & they asked to send alternative documents; But Lenovo support team has the habit to move to On-Hold. SO its waste of time to clear your side words.Rule No2:They need the Dealer Seal Attestation in Bill. But you wont get Seal Attestation in online order Bill. So they moved my ticket to On-Hold to upload bill with Dealer seal. So you cant avail this offer if you purchase the laptop online.In their mail, you can see customer care number and email; but you ll get respond with automated mail and voices  only.

After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.

My Worst Nightmare. Terrible Support from Lenovo.,"

  Note: I did not buy this on Amazon. I bought this frome the Lenovo website.Right when the lockdown struck us in early 2020, I decided to buy this laptop to prepare for my career progress plan.On paper this was the best config I could get under 70K (it was being sold at around 67K on Amazon then)The laptop arrived and within a couple of weeks I found out the audio was abysmal. I tried atleast 3 different earphones/headphones to make sure the problem was not with my earphones. After that contacting Lenovo was almost impossible as their lines would always be busy (limited staff the message said)And when I finally made contact, after making me update the drivers, reinstalling my OS, they shoved a 7 day (DOA - dead on arrival) policy in my face saying that since I had not reported it within 7 days I would not be offered a replacement. The best they said was they could get someone to repair/replace the motherboard.I put my foot down and so did they. The consumer forum was no big help either. So now I am stuck with a 60K+ laptop with a crackling audio which means my learning plans get crippled and I am left with a glorified browser.btw the laptop speakers are useless. At full volume you will get some decent sound.Moral: In the first seven days, test out all you can, and if you find one thing out of line, do not hang up till they connect (This comes with a one year support warranty)The next machine I buy will definitely not be a Lenovo.

"Sleek yet Heavy, Powerful yet weak !","

  The laptop is a beast when it comes to performance and ease of use. The design is very sleek. From afar, it just looks like a sheet of steel when closed. However, its not very light as it looks to be. I expected it to be much lighter and was disappointed with its weight.The battery performance is decent. I am getting around 5-6 hours of battery. I only browse, watch tutorial videos and code (heavily).The most disappointing feature of this device is its sound. The quality of the speakers is just pre-historic. Very feeble in sound. I have to connect to a earphone each time I have to listen to a video.The display quality is excellent. Lenovo has done a great job with this laptop in the display aspect.The laptop is best if you are a working professional or a coder. But if you want to game, create content, and for any general entertainment purposes, I don't recommend it.

Worth every penny,"

  13/11/2020:The screen flickering issue is still an issue when the laptop is not placed on a stable ground, like if you hold the laptop in your hand in air the screen tends to flicker, I guess its some kind of loose connection or something. But nothing is wrong when it is placed on a laptop and screen is at any angle.This issue was solved when I updated windows but I guess it was a mere coincidence that it got solved right at that time.One thing I didn't like is that the USB and power port at both really tight, maybe due to the slim design. It's hard to plug in and plug out through the ports. You feel like it's gonna break.9/11/2020:There was a screen flickering issue, which was solved when the nvidia and bios was updated. Warrenty issue was fixed by mailing the amazon invoice to pop@lenovo.comSo you don't have to worry about these two issues.I saw a few reviews where the hinge was broken, luckily I didn't have this problem until now and don't know if it will fall apart after daily usage. For the camera part some reviews have shown it is the wost camera in a laptop. I feel these people haven't used a webcam before and was expecting high selfie qualities in a laptop. The camera is pretty decent, I must say. I thought it will be really bad after reading reviews, but I'm really happy about it. The bootup speed is 7-8 seconds and finger print unlock works in just a second. And for the weight, its pretty heavy and not a lightweight laptop. It weights around 1.8kg to 1.9kg but the build quality except the hinge is really good. With the lenovo vantage app the updates and customisation of different modes is really easy.Display and sound quality is good. I will update this review after heavy and long usage.

  Like others users i also made the same mistake of not watching the reviews. I bought this laptop in august and within a month the hinge broke with a crack noise, and the further u try to open the worse it gets. Talking about lenovo service probably the worst in the world. After putting up a complaint finally an absolutely useless texhnician came who instead of replacing the part further cracked my screen and b cover. It has been more than a month now and after hundreds of calls to lenovo premium care the laptop is still broken with a broken hinge, cracked screen  and b cover. I have also been making visits to the service centre now but no luck they have even stopped taking my calls. I bought it on emi and have just paid 2 installments and haven't been able to use my laptop 20 days after i bought. Don't know where to complaint now. Please do not buy this product a humble req.

  This laptop is a great package you might get in this range. But after 1 year of use, my laptop screen suddenly developed pink patches all over the screen. And unfortunately my warranty was over so the Lenovo chat/email service didn't address my issue and I had to get it repaired from the service centre. Although the same problem might not happen with you because I used my laptop extensively (about 12 hours a day), and developing a issue after such a heavy use is normal. But if you are considering buying this laptop I will highly recommend extending your warranty from 1 year to about 3 years by paying some extra charges on pcsupport.lenovo.com

  Best laptop from lenovo in the budget of 60-70kNote i got this at 61k from lenovo offline showroom....so i would suggest you to buy it offline as here you are paying 10k extra plus you have to wait also....I heard about the screen flickering issue from reviews but i have not faced any screen flickering issue till using it for 5 months now.....For specification you can read other reviews.... This is very useful for student and professional for coding use.....gamers stay away.....u can play games in it  but it's not built for gaming purpose nd may face issues later...

"Pathetic build quality, heating issue, horrible customer service, and just another average laptop.","

  Bought this laptop in August looking at the decent specifications, didn't know that the disappointment will start in September. The bezel of the laptop came out in less than a month and since then to date, I am following up with the customer relationship team of Lenovo to resolve this but absolutely no response. The build quality of the laptop and the body of laptop is, simply put, horrible. The battery life is decent however it faces a heating issue. The good thing is the privacy shutter can hide the pathetic camera of the laptop. So not go by the fancy specifications of the laptop, trust me this comes from personal experience, it's not worth it. I have now understood why people keep recommending HP & DELL only over Lenovo. I am writing this so that no one has to learn this the hard way like I did. Do not buy this laptop. Lenovo is one of those companies which has zero after sale interest. Neither will Amazon help you.

  The product arrived in good condition. As the warranty is from manufacturing date, I have 11 month warranty remaining. Not a big deal for me, as I fix my own laptop.With a weeks testing, the laptop is good for decent workloads. People who face issue (crashes etc.) watching YouTube videos, make sure to make nvidia your default graphics card for your browsers and other applications. The default is intel’s integrated graphics card. Sadly you have to set this for each program individually. This also frees up CPU resources. 8gb ram is okay (no lag found yet) for normal workloads. Will upgrade the ram to 12/16gb as need arise. Battery life is okayish with battery lasting for 5-6 hrs with moderate use. This could have been better.

  Very light, sleek and beautiful laptop. Has enough power to play games with decent settings. Doesn't heat up and has a very good display. Cost is slightly on the higher side.Revising the review to a 1 star because the left hinge came off. I was confused why this happened. The service center mentioned the hinge plate is pasted to the back panel and many customers are facing this issue with this model. The service center again pasted it. Not sure for how long it will last. As a precautionary measure, they loosened the hinges. I am dissatisfied with the quality of the build.

Wood > this laptop,"

  A beautiful way to waste your money. If you have 70k and you don't like having so much money; you can buy this piece of garbage. I would suggest buying wood instead, it'll atleast keep you warm in the winter, has better life than the battery life of this 70k blunder; wood doesn't have a camera, but the one on this one is useless because the screen keeps on flickering. I have to give it to the laptop for weight, it weighs exactly same as the log of wood would.The premium support on lenovo is a joke. They 'suggest' emailing because wood.Honestly, bulky laptop with a bad screen (always flickering. It's mostly not a driver issue, it's bad wiring that I need to get them to fix on a brand new laptop). I have had bad experience with Lenovo twice now. Just buy something else.

Definite yellow tinge,"

  I  received a faulty product and had to return it, there was some issue with current leaking in the base and near mousepad.But when I did try the laptop there was definite yellow tinge on the screen which will not go away with any settings.Return experience was the worst, My laptop was picked after 4 visits by delivery guys each time refusing to pick because the son was in small fonts which they are not aware of and were looking for stickers. I made at least 10 escalations to amazon each time be assured there will be no issue but the story did not change. Finally, a different delivery person came I showed him where the serial number is and he took.Beware there is no real communication link between the amazon business team, leadership(because my case was escalated to leadership team), and the local person handling pickup, they have no control on them.I will strongly advise to buy costly gadgets from your local dealers. If you are stuck with a faulty gadget with even minor issue , amazon business team will not be able to resolve it for you.

  i had got this laptop for personal use and basic image editing. sadly the screen on this laptop turned out to be pathetic :(  i had a lenovo earlier (which had a much better screen in terms of color accuracy even though it was not FHD) hence thought of continuing the same, sadly not so happy with this model. No doubt the screen is FHD and for reading or web browsing it will be great, but there seems to be some yellow tint and certain colors are way down on contrast. They seem to be washed out. Performance wise it is amazing.Overall it is good laptop for general purpose use, but the screen color accuracy/calibration could have been better.Will check with lenovo if this is an issue with my laptop only or some feature in this laptop :P.

  As I read in reviews, I bought this product. Battery life is worse, not as mentioned in details. 93% to 36% will go in with in 60 minutes.Warranty I received only for 231 days instead 365 days.  This is also worse.Positives are that built in quality and looks.

Avoid purchase of this product!!,"

  I ordered a lenovo s540 laptop from amazon and it got delivered on 7th June.But I observed that sound was coming from the hinge then I saw that the hinge is starting to get loose/broken and now the gap is getting wider.It's very disappointing to see your new laptop is getting broken day by day on which you have spent a lot of money.This happens within month period for this premium level laptop. After following up with customer care, they refused to give replacement for this product.After replacing the display cover in July last week after 1 month I again faced the same issue again. It's a defective product/product line.Please refund my money or replace the product. It is very frustrating and disappointing to face the same issue again and again after replacing the parts.

"This laptop will put a smile on ur face (if you are not expecting a good camera). Go for it ""Laptop""","

  Got this product delivered in a day. The packing is not that great, as they wrapped a carton box which is about slightly bigger than the actual laptop box. But that's okay, as it is Amazon delivered.While checking the laptop found that the camera is not working (i.e. it was showing an orange circle even with the manual shutter open). I was about to raise a return request. But on having a closer look, I realized that there was a sticker over the camera lens mentioning about the camera manual shutter position. Once I pealed it off, I was happy to see camera is working... Oh thank God..!!!!First look review:* Laptop looks sleek but feel bit heavy while lifting. That heaviness will make you understand the build quality.* Full metal finish body.* Nice IPS display.* With Cortana enabled, Windows setup was very easy.* Excel can be seamlessly activated following the steps mentioned in YouTube video.* Wow.. It has caps lock and Num lock ""ON"" indicator light over the keys. Also a watermark displayed on screen while toggling them. (not some thing new, but feeling good as my earlier laptop didn't have this).* Nice back-lit keyboard. Initially I felt there is no much difference between two brightness levels in normal light. But on low light I could see significant difference in brightness levels.* The keyboard tray is sturdy.* Eye catching chrome boarders for Power button, Track pad and Finger Print scanner.* While registering finger print, it seems slow. So I doubted will it be the same while logging in. But it is not. Finger print login works nice and fast.* Boots up and Shut down in 3-5 sec max.* You will get 1 year free subscription for McAfee LiveSafe. Good...!!* Nice quality speakers with sharp sound and pleasing chillness.* Track pad has integrated button for right and left mouse keys, which was new to me. And I was struggling to find the location of the keys. After using it for some time, I felt some what comfortable. But still being conscious while using right mouse click.* Media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Prev and Next) placements over Num-pad is a very comfortable position to use them.* While typing this review I could feel the advantage of having ""U"" shape in key bottoms. It really makes you to enjoy typing. And the key travel is very less.* Not sure why, I was hitting Num-Lock key instead of back-space when I started typing. I have to check the usual full sized keyboard layout. After using for some time, I could able to hit backspace properly.* Till now I felt laptop runs very silent. But could hear a fan spinning more for some 15-20 sec while updates was going on.* I could not see a 3D hologram sticker for Intel processor. The sticker for 10th generation processor looks very simple reflective sticker.* Finally there is a web camera just to show it is there. Because the resolution is very low.That's it.. Will update review after using it for a month.

Great Product at this price range!!!!!!!,"

  I purchased this laptop on 25/06/2020 and the delivery was made the next day itself !!!! Hats of to Amazon for delivering it in a short span during this period. I will not be talking about the general features which have been mentioned everywhere, i ll mention what stood out and what did not.1) The battery life is around 6hour mark for normal use and if used in battery saver and other battery saving modes than it can cross the 8 hour mark.2)  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON FOR THIS ONE REASON : THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 8 MONTHS THOUGH THEY PROVIDE 12MONTHS WARRANTY. This is something i would want Amazon to clarify why it is so.3) The Keyboard is of the chiclet form and honestly if you are a person who is using the laptop for a lot of typing work then i would recommend that you would reconsider. The keyboard is not bad but its definitely not good for its price.4) It comes with FREE OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2019 for the full time and not just a trial. It also comes with a 1 year MCAFEE anti virus protection plan for free.5) I was little skeptical after reading all the screen flickering issues faced by some of the people who bought the laptop, i also faced screen flickering issue but if u update your BIOS and other things, it ceases to flicker.Overall I would say this is a must buy laptop, if your price range is between 50k-75k. No other product has both the features of an Ultrabook and the abilities of a medium gaming pc.

  even though i didn""t purchase this product from amazon im reviwing this because im in love with this laptop.the laptop looks cute and sleek from all the angles you are looking at it.the overall built quality is just great as it gets a full aluminium body.i bought it for rs 66.4k and im really satisfied with my decision.it boots up in less than 8 second.thanks to its 256GB SSD. the performance is just great.it gets a backlit keyboardt.so using this cute baby at dark conditions wont be a great deal.it also gets  NVIDIA MX250 graphic card,so small gaming and editing can be done with ease.the battery performace is also impressive. i was able to get almost 5-8hours with a single charge with 15+ % remaining.the laptop looks slim ans light in weight.the ports in this laptop is adequate for a normal user.so in overall performance and fore the looks of this machine i would rate it 9.5/10.so if you are looking for a laptop under 66k this will be the suggestion from my side.comment and let me know if you find this review helpful

  I am writing this after 4 months of usage.This is the best laptops in 60 to 70 k range .Fast bootup and fast in every aspect good for professional use .When comes to gaming this will do the job with out any issue but heats a lot while gaming . Battery life is too good I am geeting aroung 5 to 6 hours for heavy usage .If you are watching any movies steaming them it easily comes for 9 hours.overall I can say just go for it.

A Premium Ultrabook with not so Premium Price.,"

  I did quite an extensive study before purchasing this laptop. Why? Because I do not replace my laptop every year or so, I am not that Ritchie Rich type. My last laptop Lenovo Z50-70 was purchased 5 years ago, and it is still rocking as per current standards although I did swap out the HDD with an SSD for performance boost and battery backup is around 2.5 – 3 hrs which is surprisingly decent as per today’s standard.My point being I already  trust Lenovo brand with longevity and after sales support, but I wanted to try other brands just for a change. Apple was out of the scene since I wanted 15.6-inch screen and a Windows OS. So, I looked for other players like Dell, HP, Asus and Acer. Asus and Acer have quite an extensive line-up but from April – June 2020, most of them are on 8th gen processors. Plus, I have my doubts regarding its after sales support because they outsource it to private vendors instead of in-home service center.Coming to Dell, I am shocked to see that people end up paying the ‘Dell tax’. What does it mean? Well a 65K Dell Inspiron has a all plastic body, two decades old TN display, terrible battery life and users complaining about constant heating issues. HP has a similar story with partial plastic body and a TN display hiding under their marketing term as ‘SVA’ display.Leaving me no choice I looked at Lenovo and I immediately liked S340 and S540 (the model I am reviewing). S340 was 5-7k less expensive but lacked fingerprint sensor and has only partial metal body. I wanted full premium experience under 65K, so I opted for the more expensive S540.All right, enough chit chatting. Now couple of pointers, you all are already bored with specs sheet, so I’m gonna spare you with that. Instead I’m gonna focus on the core user experience.Display: A display is the most important component of a laptop because you will be looking at it all the time. And it is expected to be at least good if not the best. Sadly, this is the least thought component in the segment.An FHD IPS Anti-glare display was best I was getting in this range and only Lenovo offered me from the top 3 brands. 250nits brightness is sufficient for day to day task and may feel short under direct sunlight although matte coating helps a lot in dispersing the indoor and outdoor light.I personally feel that color gamut should have been 72% NTSC or the 99%sRGB and not 45% NTSC which is the case here but then again, no other brand is offering the 72% in this price range. Not at all happy about this.Overall, if u don’t need an accurate color reproduction for professional photo editing, the display has best viewing angles, sufficient brightness and contrast for the binge watching or while working on that colorful assignment of yours.Keyboard and Touchpad: Lenovo is known for their keyboard and the one present on this device has good amount of travel, satisfying clickety clackety sound and enough spacing between the keys along with a premium glass frosted touchpad with windows precision gesture support. The inclusion of Numpad is the best decision which for some reason companies have started skimping on it and the two levels of brightness just for the backlight of the keyboard is icing on the cake.Battery Life: This model claims of up to 12 hours battery life which is a very bold claim for the given specs. I am happy to report that Lenovo lives up to their marketing term because I managed to squeeze out around 10+ hrs of battery from 100% to 35% on moderate use and I believe that it would have gone beyond 11+ hrs till it dropped dead to zero. I have also seen newer ultrabooks in the market barely touching a 5hr mark, so all in all this device has a terrific battery life without any doubts.Design: That exquisite full metal thin and angular body with diamond cut edges along with professional looking choice of color is a premium to look at and hold. The plastic body found in other brands is just no match in terms of looks and feels. Easy win for Lenovo.Processor, RAM, Graphic Card and Storage: Comet Lake Core i5 processor along with a 2gb Nvidia MX250 graphic card and 8gb of ram expandable up to 12gb with 256gb of SSD (best in this segment) and 1 TB HDD (a high quality). A good balance of storage and speed.Gamers stay away as this is meant for professionals and students and in no way can do serious gaming. This laptop tends to stay cool but running a GTA V with normal graphics and 1366 X 768p resolution heated the CPU to 65-70-degree Celsius range. And that amount of heat can affect the battery health and the laptop components with regular use.Nifty Features: Fast and Accurate Fingerprint sensor, the manual camera shutter for the privacy, the included MS Office 2019 home version along with 1 year of Lenovo Premium Warranty and Accidental Damage Protection, the Always On USB port for charging your other devices without waking up the laptop and inclusion of proper led indicators and ports (ultrabooks usually skimp out on HDMI and USB A port) overall makes this laptop the ‘Perfect’ ultrabook.But wait, there is nothing as Perfect in this world. And so far, it has been a love fest. So, bear with me for few more minutes while I cover the cons of this device.Fan Placement: I don’t like the fact that the placement of fan is at the bottom of the device. Because of its thin angular body, there was no space for a side vent thus pushing it to the bottom. At high loads, it might cause distress while using on a lap and may add to more thermal gains. Sadly, it is the case with every ultrabook out there so nothing much can be done.Speakers: Claiming to be Dolby Audio and placed at bottom of the device, these are just barely loud to cover your needs. In a quiet room they’re adequate for binge watching although it lacks the bass. I would suggest investing in good headphones or external speakers if you consume media a lot.Processor: This comes with Intel’s Comet Lake 10th Gen processor but it should have been an Ice Lake variant since it is fabricated on 10nm as opposed to 14nm and it is 2020. I guess that better display than other brands, Lenovo included was a trade-off keep the price lower and, in my opinion, a smart move. Those who are not aware, there is not much difference in terms of speed and processing it is just that Ice Lake is couple of months newer than Comet Lake.Camera: It's 2020 and Lenovo is still using a 720p HD 1MP webcam which is honestly way too bad. It's even bad for video calls. Luckily for me, I am not much into that. But if you are one of those rare breeds who rely on their laptop webcam, you have been warned.You made it to this far in the review, then I can be assured of that I started making sense all along which kept you such long and I personally thank you for sticking until now.My final thoughts to conclude the review. After a long detailed study on displays, processors and other components I came to a conclusion that Lenovo Ideapad S540 (Model: 81NG002BIN) with the thin full metal body having good display and sensible specifications along with Lenovo’s premium support for 1 year is the best bang for the buck you can get in the sub 65K market. Sure, it has some quirks but those can be simply ignored considering the overall package it fits into. I am confident that this device would be an ideal companion for College Students and Professionals likewise.

Best in Class Laptop,"

  I was looking for a laptop with the following features:1) Thin & Light Design2) 15.6 inch screen with very thin bezel3) FHD display of 1920x10804) Expandable RAM with minimum of 8GB memory5) Hybrid Storage [SSD (For fast booting)+HDD (For critical data storage)]6) Dedicated Nvidia Graphics with atleast 2GB Memory7) Core i5 10th Gen processorTo my surprise this was the only laptop on Amazon to fulfill all my requirements.I was a bit skeptical to buy this looking at the mixed reactions from people. However, I will say this is a must buy product for people having requirements inline with mine.Thermal performance was initially an issue as the laptop was heating up in a short duration but with a quick update of Lenovo Vantage app which helped in enabling the ""Intelligent Cooling"" mode from the app which fixed the issue.Battery backup is amazing as well with a wonderful display quality. I received close to 10 hours of battery backup which was mind blowing.Looks is also stunning with metallic housing and sleek design.

Hate you Amazon but love you Lenovo,"

  After a lots of study I found that this laptop is one of the best looking and featured laptop present in market in the price range between 60 to 70 K. Lenovo is a pure Chinese brand and I had bad experience in past. But the new Lenovo changed a lot. Coming back to some customers review, they reported of having received defective product and less days warrenty. Ok let me clear you all, this laptop costs arround 63 K and due to covid amazon increased the price and also I got this laptop after 15 days due to random unavailability. My 1st order got cancelled after 15 days cause they told me the order was archived (my guess due to out of stock, and for the same reason some of you got defective product) and in case of warrenty, you can update the purchase date from Lenovo's site by providing amazon's bill.Talking about laptop:Pros: Superior build quality and the unibody aluminium chessy give the laptop a premium looks, I guess this is one of the best looking laptop in the market right now. Students to business professionals, developer to casual use suits for every person. Latest Intel 10th Gen processor and Nvidia MX250 good for photo and video editing, light gaming and codding. SSD is superb, as per technical specification this is the fastest SSD installed in any device in this price range. Its a 2280 4 channel Hynix SSD and capable of 32 GBPS where rest are 2280 2 channels 16 GBPS. 2x2 intel non vpro wifi is great. Display coud be 300 nits and 72% color gamut, but its not, still manageable, though a different model of S540 have this feature but didn't find the model in amazon or local market. Extra 1 tb ssd, free windows, office 2019 and McAfee 1 year total security are extra bonus. Finger print works perfectly, keyboard backlit is ok, privacy webcam sutter is a very good features, speaker downfiring but still good. Glass touchpad just awesome. Some easter eggs like always on usb port, Charging level indicator during laptop off, lenovo vantage driver update, fast charging on-off, on laptop in ac mode without using battery, os backup and reset dedicated key and offline backup, different charging light blinking indicator, performance mode selector, different usefull function keys just extra add onsCons: RAM could be 2666Mhz, but its 2400. Bluetooth 4.2, not 5. Weight is 1.8 kg but still felt heavy. Battery very poor, max backup 4-5 hours in medium usage. Overhitting during gaming. 1 usb type c which doesn't support power delivery. Those who have screen flickering issue, please dont panic. Update bios and nvidia driver in safe mode or contact your local expart or lenovo techincl expart face to face. And yes keyboard, if you are not a lenovo user it will take time to habituate, keyboard could be better. And please provide one bag or sleeve in online purchase.Those who are interested to increase the warranty, please perches 1699 rs tps tech warrenty along with this, cause its not a cheap laptop at all.

"Wonderful machine, little pricy, Ensure you get full 1 year Warranty","

  Based on one day setup & usage experience:The Laptop has the same configuration as described. SSD makes it boot super fast. No issue in activating provided OEM software. Fingr print reader works like charm. One more very useful thing is the inbuilt Webcam cover, its a really thoughtful feature. Wonderful machine, although I fell its little pricy at 66K+. Keyboard may take a little getting used to.One warning: It mentioned 1 year Lenovo warranty, however I only see 9 months of warranty left (not sure how 3 months are lost with the seller?).

Heavy but handy,"

  Product is outstanding, gives macbook feel and i am suggesting everyone who wants to buy this product go and buy offline (bajaj electronics) i got it for 55k 128gb ssd 1tb hdd version. And they are providing a laptop bag and a mouse which worth around 2k so please dont buy this product online.

Value for Money,"

  Bought this laptop from a local store today for 2k off the price quoted on Amazon, this laptop is worth the money.Boot up time is under 7 secs, color of the laptop is mineral gray, pretty nice compared to other colors. At store, I had played video/audio on several other laptops of same configuration - thanks to the amazing IPS Full HD display, it rocked on video display compared to other laptops. Could have been better if the 8Gb RAM could be from a single slot, its currently a 4G+4G occupying 2 slots. The bezel display is another charmer, very thin, easy to carry, laptop battery gave me 7 hours on full charge. The built-in camera has two modes, to close the shutter when not in use, fingerprint sensor for secure login. Laptop came with licensed copy of Windows 10 and office, both 64-bit edition. This laptop is definitely worth the money.
