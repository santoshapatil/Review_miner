0,USE AND THROW,"  THE PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD, BUT ITS A CHINESE USE AND THROW PRODUCT, THE NAME MAY BE IMPRESSIVE ""BRAYDEN"" but I use it for once for my singapore trip, for my baby food after returning I kept it cleaned and safe, after 3 months when I opened again it never turned on.I called customer care they say it can not be repaired.So its use and throw.I strongly dont recommend, if its to be used once you can take cheaper 400-500 bucks battery blender.This product not worth.",1.0,2020-12-06

72,The Product is not worth.,"  I have purchased this product in early June and used the product occasionally  (not more than 10 -15 times). The product has been defective since the end of July.Moreover, as it was assured that this product comes with a warranty of 1 year, however, there is no support for the product. There is a WhatsApp number, they will reply after ages when you post your concern. Its a wastage of time while raising and resolving the concerns. I am not happy with the product support at all, I wish I had purchased a better product.The product replacement is not the issue, it the time I am consuming for getting it replaced/ repaired. It's not worth it.Take genuine brands product only. Don't go for a cheap priced product.",1.0,2020-08-18

78,Jar was leaking and could not grind well.,"  For this product, it was wastage of money. Unfortunately there was no option for refund on return. I had to keep this item though I did not liked it because it was looking bigger but was small in size, leaking liquid when grinding and battery back up was not so good, have to charge again and again. I wanted a refund but replacement is the only available option.",1.0,2020-08-10
79,Useful but lots to take care in design.,"  I bought this blender for making smoothies and for making fruit juice.It works pretty well as a blender for bruits, but not so good with nuts and dry fruits. It couldn't even cut through the dry fruits we find in oats. blends mangoes, avocados, pineapple, pomegranate ,etc really well.The next issue I found was that the amount you can actually blend in this is really low. The mark on the glass is almost half of the bottle.After almost a month I noticed that the blender stops blending after 1 full round of blend.(around 10 sec). Then when you try switching on, it stops after 1 sec which is really weird.The area where the bottle joins the blender is not designed properly. there is sufficient gap for the blended material to drip down once we open. the gap is too small for wiping and I had to use ear buds to clean it off.So overall its mixed emotions. It works as a blender, but has lot of design issues to resolve.",2.0,2020-08-10

137,"First Hand Review, Loose Rubber Lining but I Love it...",  Well this is just a first hand review and I was too excited to get my hands on it. The product looks very good and easy to handle not many functions just simple double click mechanism.It comes with a glass jar I like the choice of a glass jar it feels good in hand I know it might break but that's upto how you handle it..First thing I saw when I got the package was the safety rubber lining under the rotary blades on the sides came out. But It got fixed in just a minute. And now it's running fine. Then I used it to make some cold coffee and yes the coffee does go under that lining.. and there is no other way to clean it then just stirring some water in the jar... And it's okie coz my main concern was portability and since I am only going to use it for liquids so cleaning with water is not going to be a major issue (I can always use some warm water or some vinegar or lemon to clean those really hard stains). Unless I someday decide to blend some heavy smoothies with some nuts or anything like that and let it dry in the jar for days (which is specifically not recommended for this product).I guess it is a pretty decent product until I face any battery issues in the near future as is pointed out by many in their reviews.,0.0,2020-05-23
138,Just go for it,"  I was using this item for grinding baby food since October 2019 to May 2020, more than 4 times a day. It is very convenient for travel as the size is very compact. I took It with me In air travel(in cabin luggage) also.  Once you charge it, easily it will work upto 4 days. Grinding quality is superb. Only issue is in cleaning, the blades are attached with the machine, and so while washing water may go inside through the charging slot.I could say, every penny i spent on this product got worthy.My machine stopped working in May 2020, and I am ordering it again.",0.0,2020-05-22

If it breaks, the while thing becomes unusable.‚ùå Water resistance seal around the charging port is quite flimsy and can break off easily.Final verdict:---------------If you're a casual user, like a student or a bachelor, who likes to whip up a smoothie or some fruit juice on a weekend, this is a great choice for you.",4.0,2019-11-04

Keep in mind I use it for two meals a day so far. It mashes up boiled veggies well and also makes it easy to make juice for my little one. The only thing is that the rubber rings that are inside the device as well as the bottle cap collected food particles and developed mold!! I tried to wash them after removing them, but that was a pain. So I removed the all together. This sometimes makes juices leak. But that's better than mould in my babys food. Since I don't travel with it. It's okay.Update: After 4 months it stopped working. The blender charges forever and doesn‚Äôt start at all. What a shame.",1.0,2019-09-20

Hope it will be available soon.",4.0,2019-05-21

  ¬†Fully satisfied with this product. Earlier i thought it is in a big size but the size is actually very portable and the power of the machine is fantastic. It comes with 1 year of warranty which ensures you about tha long duration performance of the product. Quality of the product is very good for sure and there is no doubt about the performance. Blades are enough sharp to make any type of juices and smoothies. And there is a safety feature in which the machine can be operated only when you fix the jar on the machine which secures you to get injured. It operates for 20 sec continuously and you can restart it by double pressing the button.  I am a hostelier and this product is very useful for me.. specially in summers.",4.0,2019-04-10
